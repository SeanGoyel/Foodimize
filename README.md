# Foodimize

## Optimize What You Eat

Foodamize is an application which gives the user the ability to see the effects and impacts of the food they eat.
This application will record food along with the effects it has on the individual who consumes it. The collected data
will be organized in a manner which provides users with the insight of which foods should be avoided and which should 
be ingested. The effect that a food item has on an individual will be categorized in specific categories which outline 
how the food made the individual feel. Users will be able to summon a list of foods that fit a certain category. For 
instance, if a user is feeling tired, they can view the foods that made them feel *Energized* in which case a list of 
foods that fit this category will be displayed. Multiple categories could also be selected; if the user is tired and 
hungry they could search for foods which made them feel *Energized* and *Full*.

This application can be used by a diverse group of people as it caters and addresses several issues in the present 
world of food and nutrition. The industry of food continues to grow rapidly with new restaurants, brands and 
alternatives. As our food options grow, our ability to keep track of certain brands / restaurants becomes comprised. 
Individuals who are avid restaurant goers and new product enthusiasts can benefit from this application. Also, people 
who have sensitivities to certain foods can use this application. All in all, anyone who wants to know the effects of 
food on their body and use this information to their benefit can use this application. This application is interesting 
for me as I enjoy several different types of food but it is challenging to keep track of the effects of everything I 
eat. I find it is exceedingly difficult to attribute the stomach discomfort I feel to a specific food item I have 
injected. I believe it is much easier to make this connections if you are actively recording and analyzing how what you 
eat effects you.

###Programing Practices:
This project was part of UBC's CPSC 210 course which heavily enforced and taught correct coding practices. 
Several of these coding practices and design principles were used in this project such as:

- Black box testing with JUnit
- Reading and creating UML diagrams 
- Implementing hierarchies
- Implementing interfaces
- Implementing bi-directional relationships
- Adhering to Cohesion and Coupling principles
- Adhering to the Liskov Substitution principle
